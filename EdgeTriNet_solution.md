## I. Project Overview
### 1. Core Objectives
Build a decentralized edge computing network to achieve lightweight semantic reasoning on terminal devices, self - reconstruction of multi - modal communication links, and a unified encrypted communication protocol. Form a three - layer distributed architecture of "Terminal Layer - Edge Layer - Central Layer".

### 2. Technical Advantages
- **Lightweight**: Terminal devices only handle semantic parsing (parameter count compressed to less than 100 million, computing power requirement ≤ mobile phone GPU).
- **Resilience**: Automatic reconstruction of multi - modal communication links (supports 12 communication methods such as 2.4G, WiFi, Bluetooth, low - frequency magnetic field, and Starlink).
- **Privacy Protection**: 99% of data is processed locally with end - to - end quantum - level encryption (cracking difficulty ≥ 10^20 operations).

## II. Three - Layer Topology Architecture Design

### 1. Terminal Layer (Edge Device Layer)
#### 1.1 Function Definition
- **Core Task**: Semantic parsing and lightweight reasoning (latency ≤ 10ms, computing power consumption ≤ 50mW).
- **Processing Flow**:

#### 2.2 Core Functions
- **Distributed Consensus**: Improved PoS algorithm (block generation time ≤ 2s, energy consumption reduced by 40%).
- **Data Aggregation**:
```python
def data_aggregation(semantic_vectors):
    # Anomaly detection: Z - score method to filter data outside 3σ
    filtered = zscore_filter(semantic_vectors)
    # Semantic fusion: Transformer - based vector aggregation
    aggregated = transformer_aggregate(filtered)
    return compressed(aggregated, ratio = 0.8)  # Compressed to 20% of the original volume
```
- **Link Scheduling**: Multi - modal routing based on Dijkstra's algorithm (latency optimization rate ≥ 30%).

#### 2.3 Performance Indicators
- **Throughput**: 100,000 times/second (single node).
- **Fault Tolerance**: Supports self - healing with 30% node failures.

### 3. Central Layer (Central Computing Layer)
#### 3.1 Positioning and Functions
- **Strategic Decision - Making**: Complex cross - regional reasoning (such as city - level energy consumption analysis, traffic flow prediction).
- **Model Update**: Federated learning framework (supports collaborative training of over 100,000 edge nodes).

#### 3.2 Technical Features
- **Data Filtering**: After pre - processing at the edge layer, only 0.1% of the data is uploaded (traffic reduced by 99.9%).
- **Security Mechanism**: Homomorphic encryption computing (supports model reasoning in the ciphertext state).

### 3. Link Self - Reconstruction Algorithm
```python
def link_reconstruction(failed_links):
    available_links = get_available_links()
    # Multi - objective optimization: latency, energy consumption, reliability
    objective = min(max(latency), min(energy), max(reliability))
    optimal_path = dijkstra(available_links, objective)
    return handshake(optimal_path)  # Automatically negotiate communication parameters
```
